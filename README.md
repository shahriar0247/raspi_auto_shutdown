# raspi_auto_shutdown

So whenever electricity goes away, raspi turns off instantly, which may cause problems, like sd card being corrupted and many, i just added raspi to my ups, and set up, if no network, then just poweroff, if not connected to the internet anymore, because my router is not with the ups, the raspi is and router will turn off, on no electricity and so will raspi after like 10 sec, and then i can safely turn off ups
